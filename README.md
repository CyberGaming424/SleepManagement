<p>There are 2 ways for players to create a daytime request. Either they can hop in a bed or they can run the command /sleep.<br>
In the config you can choose the percent of players currently online that have to agree on wanting daytime.<br>
Example usage of the config:<br>
percent: 25<br>

Which would be 25%<br>
